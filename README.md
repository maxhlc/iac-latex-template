# IAC LaTeX Template
This repository is for an unofficial LaTeX template for IAC conference papers. It was based on the Word template for the 2022 edition of the conference. This repository will not be updated regularly for future editions, therefore please check that it meets the formatting requirements of your specific edition.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
This template uses various LaTeX packages, all of which should be available through most LaTeX distributions. Additionally, XeLaTeX must be used for its font support.

### Usage
At the top of the `main.tex` file there are several commands used to define key elements, such as the copyright header, the IAC session code, title, authors, and institutions. These will be used to generate the headers, footers, and title block automatically. For the most part, the `style.sty` file should not require modifications.
